# Support for Privy Baby

Welcome to Privy Baby app support! We're here to help you get the most out of your baby tracking experience.

## Why "Privy Baby"

The Privy Baby app name effectively captures our mission. "Privy" is a charming double entendre. To be "privy to" means having access to private information. Also, a "privy" refers to an old-fashioned toilet. We thought this was fitting for a privacy-focused app that helps a new parent monitor their baby's diaper. 

## Privy Baby Mission Statement

We designed this app initially for our own family, guided by our professional understanding of data privacy and security. Every feature reflects our commitment to keeping our family's information secure and private. We understand the importance of protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI). We believe we (the caretaker) should be "privy to" our baby's developmental story. We are sharing our app so other new parents like you can put your family first. Your baby's information belongs to you. 

## Our Promise

We built Privy Baby to benefit families like ours. If our app helps other caregivers gain better insights into their baby's patterns and development while maintaining complete control over their data, then we've succeeded in our mission.

Your baby's story is yours to tell. We're just here to help you track itâ€”privately.
